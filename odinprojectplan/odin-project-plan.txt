✅ Step-by-Step Plan
🔹 PART 1: The Odin Project (TOP)
1. Understand the Structure
TOP is divided into main paths:

Foundations

Full Stack JavaScript Path

Full Stack Ruby on Rails Path (optional)

Each section has:

Lessons

Assignments

Projects (major milestones)

2. Find Assignments / Projects in TOP
Do this:

Go to: https://www.theodinproject.com

Choose the Full Stack JavaScript Path

Start with Foundations
At the end of each lesson or section, you’ll see:

✅ Checklists

📘 Assignments

🛠️ Projects

Tip: Use the sidebar to navigate easily and keep track.

🚀 Track & Push to GitHub
Once you start doing the assignments/projects, do the following:

🔸 Step A: Set Up a GitHub Repo
Go to https://github.com

Click on "New repository"

Name it something like odin-project-solutions

Choose public or private

Initialize with a README (optional)

Click Create repository

🔸 Step B: Set Up Local Development
On your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Clone your repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/odin-project-solutions.git
cd odin-project-solutions

# Make folders by section
mkdir foundations
cd foundations
mkdir landing-page
cd landing-page
Start working on your project (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.)

🔸 Step C: Commit & Push to GitHub
After completing an assignment or project:

bash
Copy

# Make sure you’re inside the project folder
git add .

🔜 PART 2: Full Stack Open (FSO)
Once you're done with TOP or want to work in parallel, we'll move on to Full Stack Open. That one includes more backend (Node.js, Express) and React, and it also has assignments and projects to submit.

Let me know once you're ready to move to Full Stack Open or if you want help with your first commit or project structure.
